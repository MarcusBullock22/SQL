# SQL

I have spent a lot of time writing SQL queries throughout my years in development. Most of them are from a pawn software I helped rewrite.
Unfortunately, that software no longer exists. Nevertheless, I've recreated useful scripts from my time along with ones that have helped over the
years to showcase some intensive work. All tables, logic, and variables have been rewritten.
